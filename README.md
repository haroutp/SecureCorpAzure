Enterprise Azure Security Architecture - Zero Trust Implementation

## Project Context

### Real-World Scenario
This project demonstrates enhancing an EXISTING Azure AD environment with additional security controls - a common enterprise scenario where you must:
- Work within existing constraints
- Not disrupt current operations  
- Layer additional security without conflicts
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Integration Challenges Solved
- Integrated 5 new policies without disrupting [X] existing policies
- Ensured no policy conflicts or overlaps
- Maintained separate namespace (CA00X) for clear governance
- Preserved existing break-glass procedures
